Woodworking Projects
A piece of furniture each year of university.



About

Starting before my freshman year at Loyola, I decided to put my woodworking skills to work during my summer break. Of course my freshman dorm was only big enough to fit one small side table, but as the years progressed, so did the size of my bedrooms. I wanted to make a bit of tradition out of it, so I continued to make one piece of furniture each summer and now I have an apartment full of my own hand-crafted decor.

Coffee Table

With a glass centered top, this dual-level coffee table will be the centerpiece of my living room for my senior year.


Work Desk

My junior year I moved into my first apartment and brought a desk big enough for my computer, speakers, and of course books.




Shoe Rack

Using zipper jointed legs, this seven-shelved shoe rack holds all my shoes and doubles as a tie holder on its left side.



Side Table

This side table is a detachable set of piped legs supporting a crate on top.
